## Definition of direct product of vector spaces
If $A$ and $B$ are two vector spaces, then the **direct product space** $A \times B$ is defined as a vector space whose set is the cartesian product $A \times B$ and whose operations are

 - vector addition: $(a, b) + (c, d) := (a + c, b + d)$
 - scalar multiplication: $c \cdot (a, b) := (ca, cb)$.

these are both clearly well-defined. $A \times B$ forms an abelian group under this addition operation since all the properties hold for each component. Scalar multiplication obeys the proper vector space axioms for the same reason. So $A \times B$ is a vector space. Note that it can be thought of as the two vector spaces $A$ and $B$ operating "in parallel".

## Unique representation in direct sums
If $V = A \oplus B$, then for all $v \in V$ there is a unique pair $(a, b)$ with $a \in A$, $b \in B$, such that $v = a + b$.

*Proof:* It was previously proved that at least one such pair exists. To prove it unique, assume $(a_1, b_1)$ is a pair that works. Then $v = a + b = a_1 + b_1$, so we can group together elements of the same vector spaces on the same side of the equation, i.e. $a - a_1 = b_1 - b$. So $a - a_1$ is an element of $A \cap B$. But since we assumed that $V$ was a direct sum of $A$ and $B$, we must have $a - a_1 = 0$. So in fact the pair is unique.

## Direct product is isomorphic to direct sum
If $V = A \oplus B$ for vector spaces $A$ and $B$, then $V \cong A \times B$.

*Proof:* We define a mapping $f: V \to A \times B$ by $v \mapsto (a, b)$ where $(a, b)$ is the unique pair such that $v = a + b$. Obviously this mapping is injective, and it must be surjective as well since for any $c \in A$, $d \in B$, $c + d \in V$. It's linear because, supposing $v = a + b$ and $w = c + d$, for any scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have $f(\alpha v + \beta w) = (\alpha a + \beta c, \alpha b + \beta d) = \alpha f(v) + \beta f(w)$.

## Vector spaces of functions, linear functionals, dual spaces
For any set $X$ and field $\mathbb{F}$, consider the set $\mathbb{F}^X$ of all functions $X \to \mathbb{F}$. We can define a vector space on $\mathbb{F}^X$ by:

 - $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
 - $(c \cdot f)(x) = c f(x)$

This is a vector space for essentially the same reason the direct product was: addition of functions is defined component wise, and component-wise addition is commutative, associative, has an additive identity and additive inverses, due to the components belonging to a field. Similarly the scalar multiplication properties hold.

Since $X$ was arbitrary, in particular $X$ could be the underlying set of a vector space, say $V$. We are in particular interested in a subspace of this vector space: the space of all linear functions from $V \to \mathbb{F}$, where $V$ is a vector space whose field is $\mathbb{F}$. 

We have to prove a couple things first. To begin, what does "linear" even mean here? Linear maps are homomorphisms between vector spaces, but $\mathbb{F}$ isn't a vector space, right? Au contraire, because we can consider any field as a vector space over itself! Clearly the field addition makes $\mathbb{F}$ into an abelian group, and the scalar multiplication (as regular field multiplication) makes all the other properties work as well.

Now we have to prove that it is in fact a subspace. But if $f$ and $g$ are linear functions $V \to \mathbb{F}$, then for any scalars $a, b$ and vectors $u, v$, we have $(f + g)(au + bv) = f(au + bv) + g(au + bv) = a f(u) + b f(v) + a g(u) + b g(v) = a (f + g)(u) + b (f + g)(v)$, so $(f+g)$ is linear. Also, $(cf)(au + bv) = c f(au + bv) = ca f(u) + cb f(v) = a (cf)(u) + b (cf)(v)$.

We call a linear function $V \to \mathbb{F}$ a **linear funcitonal**, and we call the vector space of all linear functionals $V \to \mathbb{F}$ the **dual space** of $V$.
